### Telecommunication Customer Churn Prediction Model

**Brief Description:**  
Developed a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning from a telecommunications company, leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize customer retention strategies.

**Time Period:**  
January 2022 - April 2022


**Tools:**  
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, SMOTE, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Achievements:**
- Analyzed a dataset containing 7,043 customer records with 21 features, including customer demographics, service usage, and billing information, to identify patterns associated with customer churn.
- Implemented data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization, ensuring high-quality inputs for model training.
- Developed multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and LightGBM, using 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance and selecting the best-performing model based on ROC-AUC and F1 scores.
- Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance in the dataset, improving the model's ability to accurately predict customer churn in minority classes.
- Deployed the final model and generated a churn probability ranking list, providing actionable insights for targeted customer retention efforts.
